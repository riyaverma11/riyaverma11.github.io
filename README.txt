Hi! This is my personal website that I created using HTML 5UP!

In the website, I've shared my involvement at Purdue University, listed my classes and additional certificates, detailed my work experience, and highlighted a few projects I've worked on. 

Thanks for taking the time to look over the code for my website :)
