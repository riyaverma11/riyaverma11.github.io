							<h2>About Me!</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Hi! Thanks for stopping by : )</p>
						<p>My name is Riya and I recently graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor's in Computer
							Science.
							At school, I spent a lot of time participating in
							organizations like The Association of Multicultural Computer Scientists,
							<a href="https://purdueusb.com/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Student Board</a>, and 
							<a href="https://boilermake.org/about" target="_blank">BoilerMake</a>.
							I also worked as a Student Ambassador for the Department of Computer Science.
							<br>
							In my free time, I enjoy playing Animal Crossing, biking, and baking! I am also an avid fan
							of
							Taylor Swift, BTS, anime, and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I've watched all the
							movies at least 3 times)!

				<div class="leftAlign">
					<h3><b>Purdue Dept. of Computer Science</b> · <i>CS307 Teaching Assistant</i>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;January 2024 - May 2024
					</h3>
					<p>
						In progress!

					<h3><b>Cisco</b> · <i>Software Engineering Intern</i>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;May 2023 - August 2023</h3>
					<p>At Cisco, I worked as a software engineering intern in Supply Chain Operations! This gave me
						the unique chance to learn more about how supply chain works and how technology is permeating
						every step of the
						process. My project for the summer was to integrate OpenTelemetry (OTEL), an observability
						framework, into a Python
						microservice architecture and to enable comprehensive distributed tracing capabilities for
						monitoring and debugging
						purposes. In order to do so, I conducted thorough research on OTEL's capabilities, best
						practices, and available
						Python libraries to design an effective integration strategy. To allow for deeper insights into
						the application's
						behavior and bottlenecks, I developed custom instrumentation code for specific business logic
						and
						performance-critical sections.
					</p>

					<h3><b>JPMorgan Chase</b> · <i>Software Engineering Intern</i>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;June 2022 - August 2022</h3>
					<p>At JPMorgan Chase, I had the opportunity to work on implementing a micro front-end application.
						With micro front-end, a user
						experiences a seamless web application, however, behind the scenes the different features on the
						page
						are actually independent projects with their own front-ends and backends. This summer, I used
						Angular and Webpack 5 Module
						Federation to incorporate a Dashboard project onto an existing request tool app used by business
						owners. The goal of the project
						was to link both of the applications together to guarantee a seamless user experience and
						improve the business's efficiency!
					</p>

					<h3><b>Purdue Dept. of Computer Science</b> · <i>CS193 Teaching Assistant Coordinator</i>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;June 2022 - May 2024</h3>
					<p>CS193 is a required, introductory course in programming tools for over 800 first-year students in
						the Computer Science Department.
						As the Teaching Assistant
						(TA) Coordinator of CS193, I manage a team of TAs and my responsibilities include overseeing
						grading deadlines, leading bi-weekly
						touchpoint meetings, and coordinating 1:1 discussions regarding feedback. I also act as one of
						the leads for the course.
						Over the summer, we review the lecture content and corresponding homework and to conduct
						interviews in order to hire teaching assistants.
					</p>
					<hr>

					<h3><b>Purdue School of Aeronautics and Astronautics</b> · <i>Web Development Intern</i>
						&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;August 2021 - August 2023</h3>
					<p>Over the past two years, I have gotten the chance to better understand the web development
						process from
						coding to customer expectations. Since I create pages on the School's website, I have learned
						how to
						maintain the consistency
						of Purdue's brand amongst the different pages, while keeping accessibility in mind.
						Additionally, I work closely with the School's Marketing and Communication Specialist, which
						allowed me to learn how to best
						convey information to users.

					1<sup>st</sup> Place Cisco Supply Chain Showcase
				</button>
				<div class="flop">
					<p>Along with my intern project, I competed in a Supply Chain Showcase. My team and I assessed
						inventory/material impact due to demand changes, which involves multiple tools and iterative
						analysis. The sheer number of resources to reference delays response and results in lost 
						opportunity to mitigate Excess and Inventory (E&O). The project necessitated examining existing 
						inventory sources to establish an approach for evaluating the exposure to E&O items, as well as 
						recognizing prospects for mitigation. For our solution, we created a single source of
						truth in the form of a dashboard to make the data more visual and accessible. To assess the impact 
						of EDI changes, cancellation, customer push outs, and product mix changes, the dashboard highlights 
						significant increases and decreases in quantity of each part included in the report. This way the 
						changes are brought to the attention of admins as soon as possible, rather than being hidden amongst
						thousands of rows of data.
