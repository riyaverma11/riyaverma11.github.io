								<h2><b>My Involvement</b></h2>
								<div class="leftAlign">
									<h3><u>Association of Multicultural Computer Scientists (AMCS) · President</u></h3>
									<h4>August 2020 - Present</h4>
									<p>The goal of AMCS is to create a community and foster equity within the CS department. In order to achieve that, 
										I lead meetings with the board members to plan events, like career panels, networking opportunities, and socials!
										So far, our most successful event was a final exam review session for CS250: Computer Architecture; an after class 
										event where the professor of the course went over concepts from the semester to 100+ students. 
										Beyond that, in the past two years we've worked alongside two companies: Liberty Mutual and Bloomberg!
										Liberty Mutual's university recruiter held a Resume Workshop, where attendants learned about the best practices of creating 
										and maintaining a resume.
										Bloomberg partnered with us to host a “Day in the Life of a Bloomberg Software Engineer” event so that students could learn 
										more about what the company is like from employees' perspective!
										In the coming years, I hope to expand the organization's reach to underclassmen so that they feel more at home with 
										the CS department, while focusing on our goal of equity.
									</p>

									<h3><u>BoilerMake · UX Exec Team Member</u></h3>
									<h4>March 2022 - Present</h4>
									<p>BoilerMake is Purdue's largest hackathon with the event running for 36 hours and having over 400 participants!
										As the Lead for UX, I am actively involved in recruiting new members for BoilerMake, overseeing, 
										delegating, and helping out with all of the tasks assigned to the team, conveying my team's updates 
										to the other teams, and being the main point of contact leading up to and on the day of the hackathon.</p>
									<p>As a member of the UX team, I work to create a smooth and overall enjoyable hackathon experience.
										The main goal of the UX team is to coordinate all logistics of the actual event. Behind the scenes, 
										we focus on managing the hackathon's schedule and layout, and any hacker-related needs like 
										swag, food, activities, and tech-talks!
										I, personally, was responsible for organizing the merchandise that was given to hackers
										and handling the venue's decoration according to the hackathon's theme, Carnival!
									</p>

									<h3><u>CS Undergraduate Student Board (USB) · Member</u></h3>
									<h4>March 2022 - Present</h4>
									<p>CS USB is dedicated to improving the student experience within Computer and Data Sciences at Purdue. 
										The organization also works to to create a supportive and engaged community the department, while advocating for 
										the student body. As a member, I have dedicated my time towards two initiatives: CS193 and the International Student 
										Networking Event. CS193 is a required, introductory course in programming tools for all first-year CS/DS 
										students. I work as the TA Coordinator and one of the leads of the class!
										The International Student Networking Event initiative was created with the goal of helping 
										international students connect with resources to help them navigate their time at Purdue. My role as the 
										AMCS respresentative in this initiative means using the AMCS platform and resources to help in any way possible!
									</p>

									<h3><u>Dept. of Computer Science · Student Ambassador</u></h3>
									<h4>June 2022 - Present</h4>
									<p>Being a Student Ambassador gives me the chance to attend the Computer Science "Purdue's for Me" and 
										"Introducing Purdue" information sessions as a student liason. During those sessions, 
										I introduce the department to prospective students and their families.
										By talking about my past years at Purdue and giving tours of the CS Lawson Building, I share my unique
										perspective about how Purdue has impacted my educational, professional, and personal growth.
									</p>

									<h3><u>Purdue Hack the Future · Front-end developer and Designer</u></h3>
									<h4>September 2020 - February 2022</h4>
									<p>
										Hack the Future aims to create software and technology related project for nonprofits in West 
										Lafayette. My role on the team was to create mock-ups for our application and to work 
										as a front-end developer. As the designer, I took user and company feedback to improve my designs. 
										This really helped inform our work during development since we better understood what and why the 
										organization needed! It was incredibly inspiring to be on a team that worked to improve our community.
									</p>

									<h3><u>Purdue Boiler Gold Rush · Team Leader</u></h3>
									<h4>February 2021 - September 2021</h4>
									<p>
										Boiler Gold Rush is a welcome week orientation program for all new undergraduate students (first years 
										and transfers)! As a team leader, I had the opportunity to create an inclusive environment for students 
										in order to prepare them for their college experience. Furthermore, I introduced and connected the students 
										to Purdue through social and academic programming.
									</p>

									<h3><u>Earhart Itasca Club · Community Senator</u></h3>
									<h4>September 2020 - May 2021</h4>
									<p>
										The Itasca Club is Earhart Hall's Student Government. As a Senator, I delivered proposals at Governing 
										Board meetings representing my floormates, served as the direct line of communication between ITASCA and 
										the residents on my floor, and streamlined the meeting cadence to plan and promote events for the residence 
										hall. Additionally, I decorated my dorm floor for holidays and created care packages to boost morale 
										during COVID-19.
